The Love and the Breakup Letter,72,8,Users write down their own thoughts and feelings regarding a product.,"Users’ feelings, thoughts, memories and attitude towards a product.",Workshop participants write their own love or breakup letters and then share their letters with the other participants and researchers/facilitators.,"The method of writing love and breakup letters aid participants of e.g. design workshops, group interviews or icebreaker sessions in communicating any positive or negative feelings towards a product. The method can traditionally be applied during phases one, two or five. In the beginning, the participants are asked to write either a love or a breakup letter, or both, towards a sometimes predefined product. The output are letters that provide surprisingly good insights into the mindspace of the participants and users of the products. Participants tend to get very personal and dramatic when writing their letters, leading those letters to provide great insight into what people like or dislike about a product. While the Love Letter explores the origins of positive feelings such as delight and loyalty, the Breakup Letter explores the reasons why a user has experienced a negative relationship with the product. Both types of letters help the researchers better understand the dynamics of the user-product relationship (Hanington & Martin, 2019, p. 150).
Having participants read their letters aloud to the group helps facilitate discussions and provides the opportunity to ask other participants if they agree or have experienced similar feelings in order to measure how common those feelings are. Laughley et al. recommend that all participants finish reading their letters aloud before the group engages in discussion, so that no one feels discouraged in sharing their feelings if someone else has already expressed similar thoughts and received negative feedback (Laughey et al., 2021).
Participants are usually not given a very long time to write their letters. Some recommend as little as ten minutes so that participants don’t overthink the assignment (Crawford, 2021).
","My experience with this method is that it is a really fun method for participants who are given total freedom to express any feelings they might have towards the product they are writing about. It can be time consuming if the person wants to make the letter perfect, so therefore it is important to set a time limit to the writing activities. In my opinion ten to thirty minutes would suffice, depending on how much details the researchers want to receive. 
Some drawbacks of the method that I see are that the participants might get overly dramatic and make their problems or likes sound more important than they really are, and that some people might not feel comfortable sharing their letters with the whole group. However the method is still a great way to quickly point out the pros and cons of a product with real users.

Design Fiction,38,4,Designer writes a fictional story about realistic yet hypothetical objects.,Imaginary narratives and contexts regarding a hypothetical object.,Provides the designer with imaginary portrayals of an object that he can use to explore the potential advantages and disadvantages of the object.,"The Design Fiction method is one that pushes the designer’s imagination. Contrary to traditional prototyping where existing functionality is investigated, an imaginary scenario is created and its surrounding world is explored. This method is usually applied in phases two or three. Design fiction has been described as a narrower genre of speculative design where the “fiction” refers to science fiction due to the technological roots of design fiction and as such the focus is on what kind of technology the future may hold. Design fictions are usually more celebrative of technological advancements rather than challenging them or questioning (Dunne & Raby, p. 100). Design Fiction is a world-building exercise that speculates about the technological future, where the designer creates a future world, explores what kind of technology this world has and ponders the implications certain technology can have on that world. This provides the designer with a tool to evaluate the outcomes and repercussions of a design, e.g. what the social or ethical consequences of a certain design are. But what happens if the design product has bad consequences or even causes harm to the fictional users? The designer is free to generate any story he wants, so he can also choose what story he does not want to tell and thus which outcomes he does not want to see which gives him a chance to evaluate if the world would benefit from his design or not. That is exactly the point of design fiction, to inspire reflection (Hanington & Martin, 2019, p. 82).","My experience with this method is that it can be helpful in extending the imaginative boundaries of the designer in order to come up with new ideas. In my experience it is easier and perhaps more fun to come up with a negative scenario which causes the design product to turn into some kind of satire which is not the main reason for using design fiction. It should aid reflection but that reflection doesn’t have to be on a negative note. However, as a reflective method it can be very helpful to place your existing product or idea of a product into a fictional world to “see” how the product will fare, what could happen to it and what could happen because of it.","Dunne, A., & Raby, F.

Personas,82,10,"Information about users, e.g. gathered from interviews, questionnaires or other user research methods.","A persona described through text and visual illustration/s that explain her characteristics, backstory, behavior and needs etc.",The design team uses gathered information to create a persona to aid the process of understanding the users.,"The method of creating personas revolves around understanding the people who are the users of the product. To help the designers understand and relate to these users, creating personas is one option. In order to craft personas, the designers must gather data about their users and look for the behavioral patterns that define them. Similar attributes can then be clustered together into an affinity diagram, i.e. grouping similar items together, which can help construct the different personas. A typical persona will have a name, image, backstory that describes their life, goals and behaviours and is usually described in one page or less (Hanington & Martin, 2019, p. 170).
        Personas can also be crafted for different purposes, depending on what style best suits the project. Four such types of personas are goal-directed personas, role-based personas, engaging personas and fictional personas. Goal-directed personas can be used to investigate the user’s process and workflow when trying to reach whatever goal their interaction with the product has. Role-based personas are also goal-directed but focus on the user’s behaviour and are based on qualitative and quantitative data gathered about users. Engaging personas can be both goal-directed and role-based and their purpose is to allow designers to engage with them and see them as real users in order to examine the user’s emotions, psychology, backgrounds and relevance. Finally, fictional personas emerge from the assumptions of the design team based on their previous experience and interaction with users in order to envision what a typical user looks like  (Dam & Siang, 2020).
","My experience with this method is that it works well when defining and detailing the user group. The method helps the designers see the users as real people by gathering what is known about them and creating different personas that the designers get to know in the process. While it can be a fun activity, it can also take some time if the goal is to create multiple personas with many details, so it might be better to limit the number of personas and do them well instead of trying to produce many of them. It is also important that the personas remain realistic and don’t become caricatures of the real users.","Dam, R. F., & Siang, T. Y. (2020, December 23). Personas - A Simple Introduction. The

Scenarios,92,10,Information about the users and their experience with a product.,A descriptive story that chronicles the experience of a user’s interaction with the product. ,"The design team creates a story about how a user might interact with the product, what his goals are and what hardships he might face in the process.","A scenario is a description of a situation in which a user engages with the product. It is seen from the user’s perspective, and is usually set in the future. A scenario’s purpose is to make the design ideas tangible in order to help the designers come up with future use cases and ways to interact with the product. Each scenario is written in the form of a story and focuses on what the product can help the user do and what he can do with the product (Hanington & Martin, 2019, p. 190).
        Scenarios are a great way to describe and visualize archetypal activities of the user and can be used both early and continuously in the design process. The benefit of using them early is that they provide use cases even before the situations in which they are used are created. The elements of a scenario include a setting, actors, actions, events, objectives and goals (Carroll, 2000).
        Scenarios are not only for exploring future interactions, but can also be used to analyse current user behaviour in order to identify any limitations or dislikes that people might experience when using the product. Scenarios aid with the exploration of user needs and requirements as well as discussion of context. Although it can, it doesn’t need to explain how the technology works and it is usually phrased in plain words, that is in a way that is easily communicated to the stakeholders. Stakeholders should be able to relate easily to the story-based scenarios to understand the user’s goals for the product (Sharp et al., 2019).
","My experience with scenarios is that they help the designers understand the steps a user might take when using a product. Users may have different reasons for using the products and they may encounter different problems with it, for example I take the bus because I don’t have a car in Sweden but Greta Thunberg will take the bus to be environmentally friendly. I will also prefer the bus when in Sweden but in my home country I will prefer driving myself. An old person might prefer using a physical bus card while an international student prefers using the app, but the student runs into problems when purchasing a student ticket because he doesn’t have a personnummer. These are just small examples but they show how different users will have different needs and the designers will have to understand the different ways users interact with their products.","Carroll, J.
